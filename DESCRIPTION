Description: Allows users to create weighted confusion matrices and accuracy
    metrics that help with the model selection process for classification
    problems, where distance from the correct category is important. The
    package includes several weighting schemes which can be parameterized, as
    well as custom configuration options. Furthermore, users can decide
    whether they wish to positively or negatively affect the accuracy score
    as a result of applying weights to the confusion matrix. Functions are
    included to calculate accuracy metrics for imbalanced data. Finally,
    'wconf' integrates well with the 'caret' package, but it can also work
    standalone when provided data in matrix form.
